JAVASCRIPT COUNTER
The Project
This simple JavaScript counter is one of the projects for the Master in Full Stack Development for start2impact UNIVERSITY.

The assignment:
Create a JavaScript application that allows the user to increase or decrease the counter value. Upon entering the page, the user should encounter a counter value set to 0, along with two buttons labeled “+” and “-“ to modify the value.

Application Development

The idea I started with was to recreate the counter with a design resembling a gameboy. I have incorporating the four essential elements of the application: the screen displaying the counter value, and the buttons ‘+’, ‘-‘, and ‘reset’.
